> Extended previous one-energy group reactor model to multiple energy groups.
> Parameterized neutron cross sections as a function of many reactor state variables.
> This model is ideal for nuclear fuel cycle calculations because it has execution times on the order of seconds.  
> Demonstrated this method using a standard light water reactor.
> Benchmarked this method to the same core implemented in the neutron transport code Serpent.
